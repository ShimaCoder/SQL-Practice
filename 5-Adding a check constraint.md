## Check Constraint (Command/DDL DATA DEFINATION LANGUAGE)

Check Constraint is used to limit the range / the format of the values, that can be entered for a column.

In another word it checks the values while you enter them if it fall out side of the format that we wrote it gives an error.

**Example1=** we can have the age column not to accept any value that is either negative (-30)or higher than 150 .

**Example2 =** we can have a check constraint that wont accept any letter than S and M .
