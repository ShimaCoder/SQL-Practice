No Action= itâ€™s the default behavior. Not action specifies that if an attempt is made to delete or update a row with a key referenced by foreign keys in existing rows in other tables, an error is raised and the DELETE or UPDATE is rolled back.
Set Null= Specifies that if an attempt is made to delete or update a row with a key referenced by foreign keys in existing rows in other tables, all rows containing those foreign keys are set to NULL.
Set Default= specifies that if an attempt is made to delete or update a row with a key referenced by foreign keys in existing row in other table, all rows containing those foreign keys are set to default values.
